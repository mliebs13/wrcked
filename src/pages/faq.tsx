            WRCKED IS AN AMERICAN ART COLLECTIVE DROPPING LITHOGRAPHS. WE LIKE
            WORKING WITH PIECES AS A MEDIUM BUT MARC JACOBS SUED US LAST TIME WE
            USED THEIRS, SO WE'RE MAKING OUR OWN FROM SCRATCH.

          <h2 className="mb-5 font-bold text-sm">HOW DO I BUY A LITHOGRAPH?</h2>
          <p className="font-bold text-sm">
            ALL LITHOGRAPHS WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH DIRECT SALE. OTHER TIMES
            THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE VIA DRAW. AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION, THE
            CHARGES ON YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL APPEAR AS "WRCKEDINC," WRCKEDâ€™S
            BUSINESS ENTITY.

          <h2 className="mb-5 font-bold text-sm">HOW DOES THE DRAW WORK?</h2>

          <p className="font-bold text-sm">
            EACH LITHOGRAPH IS MADE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE USING A DRAW SYSTEM
            TO GIVE EVERYONE AN EQUAL CHANCE TO GET A PAIR. ENTERING THE DRAW
            DOES NOT REQUIRE PURCHASE; WINNING THE DRAW AUTOMATICALLY CHARGES
            YOUR CARD. MAKE SURE YOUR SHIPPING AND BILLING INFORMATION IS
            ACCURATE.

            WE MAKE EXTREMELY LIMITED RUNS OF EACH COLLECTION THAT SELL OUT
            QUICKLY. AS SUCH, WE DON'T OFFER REFUNDS OR ALLOW RETURNS OR
            EXCHANGES. ONCE THEY'RE GONE, THEY'RE GONE.
